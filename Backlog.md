## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Rename orchestrator → Beth | Brand identity, memorable persona, clear leadership | 2026-01-24 |
| Consolidate frontend-engineer into developer | Developer handles both UI and full-stack; reduces redundancy | 2026-01-25 |
| Add security-reviewer agent | Enterprise security is non-negotiable | 2026-01-24 |
| Single-source tracking: Backlog.md | Simplicity over tooling. One file, one truth. | 2026-01-25 |
| Optional MCP integrations | Web search, Playwright, Azure, MS Learn MCPs enhance agents but are opt-in. Skills gracefully degrade without them. | 2026-01-24 |
