## Backlog (Prioritized)

### High Priority (P1)

- [ ] **frontend-engineer.agent.md** — Pixel-perfect React/TypeScript specialist. Separate from full-stack developer.
- [ ] **security-reviewer.agent.md** — Enterprise security agent. OWASP, compliance, threat modeling.
- [ ] **security-analysis skill** — Skill module for security workflows.
- [ ] **MCP setup guide** — Onboarding guide for optional MCP servers (web search, Playwright, Azure, Microsoft Learn). Skills gracefully degrade if not configured.

### Medium Priority (P2)

- [ ] Update all existing agents to reference Beth as orchestrator
- [ ] Add handoffs in beth.agent.md for new agents once created
- [ ] Review and update copilot-instructions.md
- [ ] **Upgrade skills for web search MCP** — Enhance researcher agent with web search when configured
- [ ] **Upgrade skills for Playwright MCP** — Enhance tester/frontend agents with browser automation
- [ ] **Upgrade skills for Azure MCP** — Enhance developer/security agents with Azure cloud ops
- [ ] **Upgrade skills for Microsoft Learn MCP** — Enhance all agents with MS Learn documentation access

### Low Priority (P3)

- [ ] Add more Beth-isms to agent responses
- [ ] Create example workflows in DEMO.md showcasing Beth's personality
- [ ] Consider additional skills (API security, performance profiling)

## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Rename orchestrator → Beth | Brand identity, memorable persona, clear leadership | 2026-01-24 |
| Split frontend-engineer from developer | Separation of concerns: UI specialists vs full-stack | 2026-01-24 |
| Add security-reviewer agent | Enterprise security is non-negotiable | 2026-01-24 |
| Two-layer tracking: Backlog.md + bd | Leadership visibility (Backlog) + agent ops (beads) | 2026-01-24 |
| Optional MCP integrations | Web search, Playwright, Azure, MS Learn MCPs enhance agents but are opt-in. Skills gracefully degrade without them. | 2026-01-24 |

## Architecture

```
Backlog.md          ← You are here (leadership view)
    │
    └── bd (beads)  ← Agent implementation tracking
           │
           └── .beads/issues/  ← Detailed work breakdown
```

**Rule:** Big picture goes in Backlog.md. Detailed implementation tracking goes in bd.
