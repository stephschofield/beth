## Completed

| Task | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Epic-Branch Protocol + Patch Queue Coordinator** | Added mandatory Epic-Branch Protocol to beth.agent.md (correlate → branch → checkout → confirm before any work). Built `src/coordinator/` module for serializing concurrent agent changes via a file-based patch queue at `.beth/patches/`. Components: types.ts (PatchEnvelope, PatchStatus, CoordinatorConfig, ApplyResult, CoordinatorError), queue.ts (PatchQueue with init/submit/dequeue/markApplied/markRejected/lock/status), apply.ts (PatchApplicator with git apply check dry-run then real apply, conflict detection, auto-commit), coordinator.ts (PatchCoordinator with applyAll/serve loop, lock-based exclusion, expired patch handling, observer callbacks). 59 new tests across 4 test files using real git repos in temp directories. Updated beth.agent.md, developer.agent.md, AGENTS.md + templates, copilot-instructions.md + templates. 501 total tests, 0 failures. |
| **Client-aware getting started guidance (beth-rvq)** | `quickstart` now detects which client was configured during `init` and shows client-specific getting-started guidance. VS Code → Copilot Chat + @Beth, Copilot CLI → terminal + copilot-instructions.md + bd ready, Claude Code → CLAUDE.md + bd prime. Client selection persisted to `.github/.beth-client.json` during init with fallback marker-file detection. New files: `src/cli/commands/client-config.ts` (persist/detect utils, 17 tests), `src/cli/commands/init-quickstart.e2e.test.ts` (10 E2E tests). Updated: `bin/cli.js` (persist call), `quickstart.ts` (client-aware output), `quickstart.test.ts` (+5 tests). 409/409 tests pass. |
| **Fix 19 pre-existing e2e test failures** | Updated `help.e2e.test.ts` (2 fixes: relaxed "Copilot Chat" → accepts "GitHub Copilot", relaxed "@Beth" → accepts "Beth"), `mcp.e2e.test.ts` (5 fixes: added `--client vscode` to init calls, relaxed server validation for command-only servers, updated to check `.vscode/mcp.json` instead of `mcp.json.example`), `pipeline.e2e.test.ts` (12 fixes: added `--client vscode` to all 14 init calls, updated mcp path checks). 52/52 e2e tests pass. |
| **Client configuration E2E tests** | 55 new e2e tests in `src/cli/commands/client-config.e2e.test.ts` validating all three `--client` modes: `vscode` (20 tests — agents, skills, settings.json, mcp.json, frontmatter validation, doctor pipeline), `copilot-cli` (9 tests — copilot-instructions, skills, no VS Code files), `claude-code` (13 tests — CLAUDE.md content, skills, no VS Code/Copilot files), cross-config (13 tests — `--client all`, shared file consistency, mode exclusivity, sequential layering, invalid client rejection). 55/55 pass. |
| **Multi-client installation support (beth-k1h)** | Added interactive client selection to `npx beth-copilot init` — users choose VS Code + Copilot, Copilot CLI, Claude Code, or all. Conditional file installation per client: VS Code gets `.github/agents/`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.vscode/settings.json`; Copilot CLI gets `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; Claude Code gets `CLAUDE.md`. All clients get `.github/skills/`, `AGENTS.md`, `Backlog.md`. New `.vscode/mcp.json` template with 4 MCP servers (beads, shadcn, playwright, deepwiki). Client-specific beads integration: VS Code prompts for `beads-mcp` install, Claude Code runs `bd setup claude`. Non-interactive `--client` flag (vscode/copilot-cli/claude-code/all). 33/33 tests pass. |
| **Simplify README architecture diagram** | Replaced the 90-line, 9-subgraph, 40+ node architecture diagram with a clean 30-line overview: 4 groups (Entry Points → Orchestration Engine → Specialist Agents → Capabilities) plus LLM connection. Old diagram was trying to be architecture docs AND overview simultaneously. Deep internals (Router, Context, HandoffManager, StreamAccumulator) remain in detailed README sections and docs/SYSTEM-FLOW.md where they belong. |
| **README update for Phases 2-4 (beth-h7i)** | Updated README.md and INSTALLATION.md to document Phase 3 (Tool Abstraction) and Phase 4 (Orchestration Engine). New architecture diagram with Orchestration Engine, Tool Abstraction Layer, and fan-out flow. New sections: Orchestration Engine (fan-out pattern with Mermaid flowchart, capabilities list, TypeScript usage), Tool Abstraction Layer (7-tool table, createDefaultRegistry/loadAllMCPTools examples). Updated: execution layers (3→5), test count (485→814), project structure (added orchestrator/router/context/handoffs/tools tree), test coverage table (9→24 rows by category). Added beads CGO troubleshooting for Linux/WSL (build-essential, CGO_ENABLED, Dolt migration recovery) to both README and INSTALLATION.md. |
| **Phase 4: Orchestration Engine COMPLETE** | Epic beth-y04 closed. 6/6 subtasks done. `src/core/` — ConversationContext (.1), AgentRouter (.2), HandoffManager (.3), Orchestrator agent loop (.4), 86 new tests (.5), barrel exports + wiring (.6). Full agentic loop: user message → route → skill injection → LLM → tool calls → subagent spawning → handoffs → response. Token-estimated context window truncation, tool call/result repair, observer callbacks, parallel subagent execution. 814 total tests (813 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail). |
| **Phase 3: Tool Abstraction Layer COMPLETE** | Epic beth-qh2 closed. 6/6 subtasks done. `src/tools/` — Tool interface, types, registry (.1), readFile + editFile (.2), search + terminal (.3), beads + subagent (.4), MCP client + bridge (.5), barrel exports + integration tests (.6). 243 tool tests, 728 total (727 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail). `createDefaultRegistry()` convenience factory, OpenAI function calling schema generation, MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio. |
| Fix package-lock.json sync + CI guard | Lock file was stale (v1.0.14, missing optionalDependencies). Regenerated with `npm install`. Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running on all branches/PRs (`npm ci`, build, test). Local pre-commit hook blocks `package.json` commits without matching lock file. Pushed to `release/v1.0.15`. |
| Run bd doctor during beth init (beth-mvp) | Added `runBeadsDoctor()` to `bin/cli.js` — after beads is installed and initialized during `npx beth-copilot init`, runs `bd doctor` to verify beads configuration health. Non-blocking (warns on failure, doesn't halt init). Same shell security pattern as `initializeBeads()`. 33/33 tests pass. |
| Comprehensive README rewrite — MCP/CLI/A2A/architecture (beth-0jf) | Full README.md rewrite with Mermaid architecture diagram (Copilot + CLI → Core Engine → Agents → Skills → MCP → Provider), Tech Stack section (12 technologies), CLI Commands table, A2A orchestration model with delegation diagram + sequence diagram with parallel quality gates, MCP integrations (5 servers), Skills trigger table (8 skills), LLM Provider Layer diagram (config → auth → Azure → streaming → retry), TypeScript Core project structure, test coverage breakdown (485 tests by suite), IDEO design thinking, quality standards with enforcement gates. |
| Add E2E tests: MCP validation, help command, init-to-doctor pipeline (beth-27j) | 3 new test files: `mcp.e2e.test.ts` (13 tests — template JSON validation, server structure, init copy/skip/force), `help.e2e.test.ts` (25 tests — all invocation methods, every CLI command/option listed, install contents documented, @Beth guidance, unknown command handling), `pipeline.e2e.test.ts` (14 tests — init→doctor compose correctly, agent/skill/beads checks, --force repairs, JSONC settings, A2A delegation enabled). Total: 52 new tests, 485 total (484 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail). |
| Beads infrastructure cleanup (Dolt migration) | Fixed metadata.json (beads.db → dolt), set beads.role=maintainer, archived SQLite artifact, cleaned worktree cruft, imported JSONL into Dolt, generated repo fingerprint (50139a6c), set sync.mode=dolt-native. 8→4 warnings, 0 errors. Follow-up: beth-b1m for remaining cosmetic warnings. |
| Update agent models + add DeepWiki MCP | All agents set to Claude Opus 4.6 (security-reviewer → GPT 5.3-codex). Added DeepWiki MCP server (`https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp`) to both `mcp.json.example` files. |
| **Phase 2: LLM Provider Integration COMPLETE** | Epic beth-47w closed. 9/9 subtasks done. `src/providers/` — types, retry, config, interface, streaming, azure client, barrel exports, 193 unit tests (359 total TS tests), test scripts updated. |
| Phase 2 Wave 4-5: tests + exports (.7, .8, .9) | 193 provider tests across 5 files (types, retry, config, streaming, azure). Barrel exports in `src/providers/index.ts`. `test:ts` script updated for providers path. CLI-ARCHITECTURE.md Phase 2 section updated to reflect reality. |
| Phase 2 Wave 3: Azure OpenAI client (.4) | `src/providers/azure.ts` — `AzureOpenAIProvider` extends `LLMProviderBase`. `AzureOpenAI` + `getBearerTokenProvider` for Entra ID auth (no API keys). Streaming with tool call deltas, error mapping to `LLMError`, retry for transient failures. `openai` v6.22.0 added. |
| Phase 2 Wave 2: interface + streaming (.1, .5) | `src/providers/interface.ts` (LLMProviderBase abstract class, ChatRequestOptions, ProviderFactory/Registry), `streaming.ts` (StreamAccumulator class, collectStream, mapStream). Parallel implementation, 239 tests pass. |
| Phase 2 Wave 1: types + retry + config (.3, .2, .6) | `src/providers/types.ts` (17 types, LLMError class), `retry.ts` (exponential backoff + jitter, RetryError), `config.ts` (env → ~/.beth/.env precedence, ConfigError). All compile clean, 239 tests pass. |
| Restructure Phase 2 dependency tree (beth-47w) | Types (.3) before interface (.1) to avoid contract churn. Streaming (.5) parallel with Azure client (.4). Added .9 for test-runner path. SDK: `openai` not `@azure/openai`. Config (.6): process.env → ~/.beth/.env precedence. |
| E2E Test Suite Implementation (beth-0nl) | 155 tests across 7 subtasks: CLI E2E (init, doctor, quickstart) + Agent validation (frontmatter, handoffs, tools, suite integration). All passing. |
| Full security review (beth-svq) | Overall risk: LOW. 0 critical/high findings. 2 medium (both well-mitigated). Clean npm audit, comprehensive path validation, minimal dependencies. |
| Fix CLI ENOTDIR crash + user-friendly errors (v1.0.13-14) | `copyDirRecursive` now detects file-vs-directory conflicts, UserError class for formatted error boxes with Problem/Fix/Command sections |
| CLI Phase 1 Complete: Agent & Skill Loaders | `src/core/agents/loader.ts`, `src/core/skills/loader.ts` with trigger extraction, 118 tests passing, updated architecture docs for Azure OpenAI |
| CLI Polish & Documentation Fixes | Fixed security-reviewer.agent.md syntax, removed unnecessary backlog.md CLI dependency, corrected agent/skill counts in help, all 86 tests passing |

## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Rename orchestrator → Beth | Brand identity, memorable persona, clear leadership | 2026-01-24 |
| Consolidate frontend-engineer into developer | Developer handles both UI and full-stack; reduces redundancy | 2026-01-25 |
| Add security-reviewer agent | Enterprise security is non-negotiable | 2026-01-24 |
| Single-source tracking: Backlog.md | Simplicity over tooling. One file, one truth. | 2026-01-25 |
| Optional MCP integrations | Web search, Playwright, Azure, MS Learn MCPs enhance agents but are opt-in. Skills gracefully degrade without them. | 2026-01-24 |
