*All P1 items completed.*

- [ ] **Review and update copilot-instructions.md** — Ensure consistency with Beth-first architecture
- [ ] **Upgrade skills for web search MCP** — Enhance researcher agent with web search when configured
- [ ] **Upgrade skills for Playwright MCP** — Enhance tester/frontend agents with browser automation
- [ ] **Upgrade skills for Azure MCP** — Enhance developer/security agents with Azure cloud ops
- [ ] **Upgrade skills for Microsoft Learn MCP** — Enhance all agents with MS Learn documentation access

### Low Priority (P3)

## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Rename orchestrator → Beth | Brand identity, memorable persona, clear leadership | 2026-01-24 |
| Split frontend-engineer from developer | Separation of concerns: UI specialists vs full-stack | 2026-01-24 |
| Add security-reviewer agent | Enterprise security is non-negotiable | 2026-01-24 |
| Single-source tracking: Backlog.md | Simplicity over tooling. One file, one truth. | 2026-01-25 |
| Optional MCP integrations | Web search, Playwright, Azure, MS Learn MCPs enhance agents but are opt-in. Skills gracefully degrade without them. | 2026-01-24 |
