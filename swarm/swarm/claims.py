"""Claims channel — path-level conflict prevention for parallel workers.

Workers post claims to the ``claims`` channel on the message board before
starting work on a set of file paths. The claims registry checks for
overlapping paths (including parent/child directory relationships) and
rejects claims that would conflict with active workers.

Claims are stored as board posts with structured metadata. A claim is
``active`` from the time it's posted until the worker posts a completion
to the ``completions`` channel, at which point the claim is released.
