# Beads Data Management: Dolt Backend with JSONL Backup

> The truth about how beads actually stores your data — no fairy tales, no aspirational docs.

## How It Actually Works

Beads uses **Dolt** (a version-controlled SQL database) as its runtime storage backend. Every `bd` command reads from and writes to a local Dolt server that auto-starts on first use.

**JSONL backup files** (`.beads/backup/*.jsonl`) are the portable, human-readable, git-trackable copy of your data. They're updated by running `bd backup` and restored via `bd backup restore`. They are your recovery mechanism when Dolt breaks — and it will break.

### The `no-db: true` Config Flag

The `.beads/config.yaml` file supports a `no-db: true` flag that is *supposed* to make `bd` skip Dolt and operate directly on JSONL files. **This flag does not work in v0.59.0 or v0.60.0.** Bd reads the flag, `beth-copilot doctor` reports it as enabled, but all operations still go through Dolt. Empirically verified: `bd create` does not update JSONL files — only `bd backup` does.

We keep `no-db: true` in config as a forward-looking setting for when the feature actually ships. It doesn't hurt anything. It just doesn't do anything either.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Install beads CLI (requires Go)
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest

# 2. Initialize in your project (creates .beads/ dir, starts Dolt)
cd /path/to/project
bd init --prefix <your-prefix>

# 3. Enable no-db flag (aspirational — see note above)
# Edit .beads/config.yaml and add: no-db: true

# 4. Verify
bd list          # Should return empty or existing issues
bd --version     # Should show >= 0.60.0
```

> **Note:** `bd init` creates a `.beads/dolt/` directory and starts a Dolt server automatically. This is expected behavior, not an error.

## File Structure

```

├── config.yaml              # Configuration
├── metadata.json            # Backend config (database name, mode, project ID)
├── backup/

├── dolt/                    # Dolt database files (runtime storage)
├── hooks/                   # Git hooks (optional)
└── *.log, *.pid, *.port     # Dolt server runtime files
```

**What matters:**
- `config.yaml` — your settings
- `metadata.json` — backend identity (do NOT corrupt this — see Troubleshooting)
- `backup/*.jsonl` — your portable data (track in git)
- `dolt/` — runtime database (gitignored, auto-created by `bd init`)

### Git Tracking Strategy

The `backup/*.jsonl` files **must be tracked in git** so issue state survives across clones and sessions. The `dolt/` directory and runtime files should be gitignored.

If your root `.gitignore` ignores `.beads/backup/` but the files are already tracked, git continues tracking them (tracked files override `.gitignore`). If setting up a new project, ensure backup files are tracked: `git add -f .beads/backup/` after `bd init`.

Recovery from git history is your safety net: `git show <commit>:.beads/backup/issues.jsonl`

## JSONL Record Format

Each line in `backup/issues.jsonl` is a self-contained JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "beth-04i",
  "title": "E2E epic test-subtask check",
  "issue_type": "epic",
  "status": "closed",
  "priority": 2,
  "created_at": "2026-03-10T05:04:09Z",
  "created_by": "Stephanie Schofield",
  "owner": "sschofield@microsoft.com",
  "close_reason": "Closed",
  "closed_at": "2026-03-10T05:04:23Z"
}
```

No relational joins. No query layer. Plain text you can grep, jq, or read with your eyes.

## Data Sync Workflow

Since bd writes to Dolt but your portable data lives in JSONL, you need to sync:

```bash
# After creating/closing/updating issues — sync Dolt → JSONL
bd backup

# After recovering JSONL from git — sync JSONL → Dolt
bd backup restore

# Always commit after backup
git add .beads/backup/
git commit -m "sync beads backup"
```

**The rule:** Run `bd backup` after write operations, then commit. This is your insurance policy.

## Commands

Every `bd` command works the same regardless of backend configuration.

### Creating Issues

```bash
# Simple task
bd create "Fix login redirect" -l in_progress

# Epic for complex work
bd create "Auth system overhaul" --type epic -p 1

# Subtask under an epic
bd create "JWT token rotation" --parent <epic-id>

# Task with a dependency
bd create "Deploy auth" --deps "<impl-id>"

# Task with description
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed description here"
```

### Reading Issues

```bash
bd list                          # All issues (human-readable table)
bd list --json                   # JSON output (fixed in v0.60.0)
bd show <id>                     # Single issue details
bd show <id> --json              # JSON output for single issue
bd ready                         # Issues with no open blockers
bd dep tree <id>                 # Dependency graph (ASCII tree)
bd dep cycles                    # Detect circular dependencies
```

### Updating Issues

```bash
bd close <id>                              # Close an issue
bd update <id> --status in_progress        # Change status
bd delete <id>                             # Delete an issue (requires --force)
bd delete --from-file <path>               # Batch delete from file of IDs
```

### Epic Management

```bash
bd epic status <id>              # Completion percentage
bd epic close-eligible           # Find epics where all children are closed
```

## Concurrency Rules

**Read this twice.**

Write operations must be sequential. This applies whether bd is using Dolt or (eventually) direct JSONL writes. Concurrent writes cause duplicate issues and lost updates.

| Operation | Safe in Parallel? | Risk if Parallel |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| `bd list` | Yes | None (read-only) |
| `bd show` | Yes | None (read-only) |
| `bd ready` | Yes | None (read-only) |
| `bd create` | **NO** | Duplicate issues |
| `bd close` | Tested safe, don't rely on it | Theoretically risky |
| `bd update` | **NO** | Last writer wins |
| `bd delete` | **NO** | Last writer wins |

### For Multi-Agent / Subagent Workflows

1. **Create all issues sequentially in the orchestrator** BEFORE spawning parallel subagents
2. Each subagent closes its own issue at the END of its work (sequential by nature)
3. **Never** have two subagents call `bd create` simultaneously

```typescript
// ❌ Parallel creates → duplicates
await Promise.all([
  exec('bd create "Task A"'),
  exec('bd create "Task B"'),
]);

// ✅ Sequential creates
await exec('bd create "Task A"');
await exec('bd create "Task B"');
```

## What NOT to Do

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Run `bd init --force` with existing data | **Zeroes ALL backup JSONL files.** Recovery requires `git show <commit>:.beads/backup/issues.jsonl`. |
| Edit `metadata.json` manually | Corrupt JSON or wrong `dolt_database` name breaks ALL bd operations. |
| Set `BEADS_DB` environment variable | Forces a specific database mode. Leave it unset. |
| Run write commands in parallel | Duplicate issues, lost updates. See concurrency rules. |
| Delete `.beads/dolt/` while bd is running | Dolt server loses its data directory. Kill the server first. |
| Assume `no-db: true` means Dolt isn't running | It's still running. The flag is non-functional in v0.59-0.60. |

## Verification

### Manual Check

```bash
# 1. Confirm config exists
cat .beads/config.yaml

# 2. Confirm JSONL has data
wc -l .beads/backup/issues.jsonl

# 3. Confirm bd works
bd list

# 4. Confirm backup is current
bd backup
```

### Via beth-copilot Doctor

```bash
npx beth-copilot doctor
```

Expected output includes:
```
✓ beads: installed (bd version 0.60.0 (dev))
✓ Beads Init: .beads/ directory present
✓ Beads no-db: no-db mode enabled
✓ JSONL data: 142 issue(s) in JSONL
```

> **Note:** If `npx beth-copilot doctor` fails with "beth: not found" due to PATH issues, use `node bin/cli.js doctor` from the repo root as a workaround.

## .gitignore for .beads/

Recommended `.beads/.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Dolt runtime (auto-created, not portable)
*.db*
dolt/
daemon.log
*.pid
*.pid.lock
*.lock
*.port
*.activity
*.log
.local_version
metadata.json

# Keep these tracked in git:
# config.yaml
# backup/*.jsonl
# hooks/
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Dolt Database Lost or Corrupt

If `bd list` fails with "database not found" or similar:

```bash
# 1. Check your JSONL backup has data
wc -l .beads/backup/issues.jsonl
# If zero, recover from git first (step 3)

# 2. Re-initialize and restore
bd init --prefix <your-prefix> --force
bd backup restore
bd list  # Verify data is back

# 3. If JSONL was zeroed by init --force, recover from git
git log --oneline -- .beads/backup/issues.jsonl
git show <good-commit>:.beads/backup/issues.jsonl > .beads/backup/issues.jsonl
git show <good-commit>:.beads/backup/events.jsonl > .beads/backup/events.jsonl
git show <good-commit>:.beads/backup/dependencies.jsonl > .beads/backup/dependencies.jsonl
bd backup restore
```

### Port Mismatch (Stale Dolt Server)

If bd can't connect to Dolt but `pgrep -f dolt` shows a process:

```bash
# Kill all Dolt processes and let bd restart cleanly
pkill -f dolt
sleep 1
bd list  # bd auto-starts a fresh Dolt server
```

### metadata.json Corruption

If `metadata.json` has invalid JSON, bd falls back to "beads" as the database name, which won't match your actual database. Symptoms: every command fails silently or returns empty results.

```bash
# Check the file
cat .beads/metadata.json | python3 -m json.tool

# If corrupt, the safest fix is re-init + restore
bd init --prefix <your-prefix> --force
bd backup restore
```

> **Critical:** Always verify `wc -l .beads/backup/issues.jsonl` is non-zero BEFORE running `bd init --force`. The init command zeroes backup files.

## Troubleshooting

### `bd show <id>` says "not found" but `bd list` shows the issue

Known intermittent issue with ID resolution. Use `bd list --json` and filter with `jq` as a workaround:

```bash
bd list --json | jq '.[] | select(.id == "<id>")'
```

### Duplicate issues after parallel creates

```bash
# Find duplicates
bd list --json | jq -r '.[].title' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head

# Delete extras
bd delete <duplicate-id> --force
```

### JSONL file corrupted or has parse errors

```bash
# Validate each line
python3 -c "
import json
for i, line in enumerate(open('.beads/backup/issues.jsonl'), 1):
    line = line.strip()
    if line:
        try: json.loads(line)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e: print(f'Line {i}: {e}')
"

# Recover from git if needed
git show <good-commit>:.beads/backup/issues.jsonl > .beads/backup/issues.jsonl
bd backup restore
```

## Config Reference

### .beads/config.yaml

```yaml
# Aspirational — does not work in v0.59-0.60. Keep it for forward compatibility.
no-db: true

# Git branch for bd sync commits (optional, for multi-repo sync)
# sync-branch: "beads-sync"
```

### .beads/metadata.json

Auto-generated by `bd init`. Do not edit manually.

```json
{
  "database": "dolt",
  "backend": "dolt",
  "dolt_mode": "server",
  "dolt_database": "<your-prefix>",
  "project_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

The `dolt_database` field must match the actual database name in Dolt. If this file is corrupt or the database name is wrong, all bd operations fail.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Does bd need Dolt? | **Yes**, in v0.59-0.60. It auto-starts a Dolt server. |
| Does `no-db: true` work? | **No**, not in current versions. The flag is recognized but non-functional. |
| Where is runtime data? | Dolt database in `.beads/dolt/` |
| Where is portable data? | `.beads/backup/*.jsonl` — synced via `bd backup` |
| Can I read JSONL with a text editor? | **Yes.** One JSON object per line. |
| How do I recover from Dolt failures? | `bd backup restore` (imports JSONL → Dolt) |
| Can agents write in parallel? | **No.** Sequential writes only. |
| Can agents read in parallel? | **Yes.** Reads are always safe. |
| What does `bd init --force` do to backups? | **Zeroes them.** Recover from git history first. |
