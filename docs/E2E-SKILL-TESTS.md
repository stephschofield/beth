# E2E Skill Routing Tests

> Test matrix for verifying every skill is routable via prompt inference.
> Generated from `.github/skills/` inventory (31 skills) and `inject-skills.mjs` hook mapping.
> Last updated: 2026-08-27
>
> Note: 35 unreferenced vendored skill bundles were removed; the matrices below
> cover the skills that remain, so test IDs are sparse rather than contiguous.

## Test Design

Each test verifies: **Given a natural-language prompt to Beth, the correct subagent is spawned and the correct skill is loaded.**

### Enforcement Layers

| Layer | Mechanism | What it proves |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Hook injection** | `inject-skills.mjs` fires on `SubagentStart` | Mandatory skills are loaded deterministically (no LLM choice) |
| **Prompt inference** | VS Code skill matching via description/triggers | Conditional skills are loaded when prompt keywords match |
| **Agent routing** | Beth selects the right `agentName` for `runSubagent()` | The right specialist handles the task |

### Test Structure

```typescript
// Parameterized test pattern
describe.each(SKILL_TEST_MATRIX)('Skill: $skill', ({ skill, agent, prompt, enforcement }) => {
  it('routes to correct agent', () => { /* verify agentName */ });
  it('loads the skill', () => { /* verify skill file read or injection */ });
});
```

## Category 1: Hook-Enforced Mandatory Skills (9 tests)

These skills are **deterministically injected** by `inject-skills.mjs`. No prompt inference needed — the hook fires on agent type alone. Tests verify the hook output, not LLM behavior.

| # | Skill | Agent | Enforcement | Test Prompt |
|---|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | `web-design-guidelines` | ux-designer | inject | "Review the login page for accessibility compliance" |
| 2 | `framer-components` | ux-designer | readFile | "Create a Framer component with property controls for a card" |
| 3 | `ui-ux-pro-max` | ux-designer | readFile | "Design a color palette and style guide for the dashboard" |
| 4 | `vercel-react-best-practices` | developer | inject | "Optimize the data fetching in our Next.js product page" |
| 5 | `shadcn-ui` | developer | readFile | "Add a shadcn dialog component for the settings modal" |
| 6 | `vercel-react-best-practices/AGENTS.md` | developer | readFile | "Refactor the server components to eliminate waterfalls" |
| 7 | `prd` | product-manager | readFile | "Create a PRD for the user notifications feature" |
| 8 | `security-analysis` | security-reviewer | readFile | "Run an OWASP security review on the auth module" |
| 9 | `web-design-guidelines` | tester | inject | "Audit the checkout flow for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance" |

> **Scope:** this matrix covers the skills present in **this repo's own** `.github/`
> dev install (~31). The **published package** ships only the 6 skills under
> `templates/.github/skills/`. The automated tests in `src/__tests__/skills/`
> deliberately run against `templates/`, so a template that references a
> non-shipped skill fails there — do not repoint them at `process.cwd()`.
>
> **Note:** `web-search` is a dev-install skill (Brave Search MCP capability
> wrapper). It is not shipped, and the `researcher` agent has no hook mapping in
> the shipped template.

## Category 2: Azure Skills (22 tests)

Conditional skills loaded by keyword matching. Primary agent is `developer` unless noted. These are the **weakest link** — they depend on LLM keyword recognition, not deterministic hooks.

| 30 | `azure-postgres` | developer | "Configure passwordless Entra ID authentication for our Postgres server" |
| 31 | `azure-quotas` (external) | developer | "Check our Azure subscription quotas and vCPU limits" |

> **External skill note:** `azure-postgres` and `azure-quotas` live in `~/.agents/skills/`, not `.github/skills/`. CI environments won't have them. Tests should handle "skill not found" gracefully.

| 72 | `agent-native-audit` | security-reviewer | "Audit the agent-native architecture for security and reliability" |

---

## Known Disambiguation Challenges

These skill pairs share semantic space. Tests MUST verify the correct one fires:

| Pair | Resolution | Test Strategy |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| `brainstorming` vs `ce:brainstorm` | `brainstorming` = freeform ("let's brainstorm"), `ce:brainstorm` = slash command (`/ce:brainstorm`) | Test both prompts, verify different skills load |
| `compound-docs` vs `ce:compound` | `compound-docs` = auto-detect ("that worked!"), `ce:compound` = slash command (`/ce:compound`) | Test trigger phrase vs slash command |
| `ce:plan` vs `deepen-plan` | Sequential pipeline: `ce:plan` creates → `deepen-plan` enriches | Test "create a plan" vs "enhance this plan" |
| `ce:review` vs `document-review` | `ce:review` = code review, `document-review` = markdown doc review | Test "review the code" vs "review this document" |
| `resolve_parallel` vs `resolve_todo_parallel` vs `resolve-pr-parallel` | Source differs: code TODOs vs CLI todos vs PR comments | Test "resolve TODOs in code" vs "resolve my todos" vs "resolve PR comments" |
| `lfg` vs `slfg` | `lfg` = sequential, `slfg` = swarm parallel | Test "execute sequentially" vs "execute with swarm" |

## Implementation Notes

### Test Infrastructure Needed

1. **Hook unit tests** ✅ — Feed mock `SubagentStart` events to `inject-skills.mjs`, verify output contains correct `additionalContext` for each agent type. These are pure functions, fully deterministic.
   - `inject-skills.test.ts` (20 tests): Unit tests for inject-skills.mjs in isolation
   - `hook-injection.test.ts` (51 tests): Parameterized tests for all Category 1 matrix entries

2. **Skill trigger coverage tests** ✅ — Verify each remaining test prompt's keywords appear in the expected skill's SKILL.md content. Catches missing triggers, wrong descriptions, keyword drift.
   - `trigger-coverage.test.ts`: Each retained test prompt's required keywords validated against actual skill content

3. **Pipeline integration tests** ✅ — Test inject-skills.mjs → verify-skills.mjs as a complete enforcement system. Verifies round-trip behavior, malformed input resilience, cross-hook consistency, and agent-specific context differentiation.
   - `pipeline-integration.test.ts` (41 tests): Full hook round-trip for all 6 agent types

4. **Agent-skill mapping completeness** ✅ — Verify no orphan skills, all hook references resolve, agent definitions exist, SKILL.md content quality.
   - `mapping-completeness.test.ts` (12 tests): Inventory validation, source-of-truth checks, content quality

5. **Skill resolution tests** ⚠️ BLOCKED — Verify VS Code's skill matching engine maps each test prompt to the expected skill file. Requires mocking the VS Code extension API which is not accessible in vitest.

6. **Agent routing integration tests** ⚠️ BLOCKED — Verify Beth selects the correct `agentName` when given each test prompt. Requires either:
   - Mocking `runSubagent` and asserting the `agentName` parameter
   - Or recording actual agent invocations in a test harness
   - This needs the VS Code Copilot extension's runtime, which is not testable in vitest

7. **External skill handling** ✅ — Skills in `~/.agents/skills/` (azure-postgres, azure-quotas) skip gracefully with `it.skipIf(!existsSync(path))` in both skill-routing.test.ts and trigger-coverage.test.ts.

### Implementation Status (2026-03-15)

| Test File | Tests | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `hook-injection.test.ts` | 51 | Category 1 hook output per agent type |
| `skill-routing.test.ts` | 223 | Categories 2-10 structural validation |
| `disambiguation.test.ts` | 28 | 8 known challenge pairs |
| `inject-skills.test.ts` | 20 | inject-skills.mjs unit tests |
| `verify-skills.test.ts` | 9 | verify-skills.mjs unit tests |
| `loader.test.ts` | 20 | Core SKILL.md parser |
| `pipeline-integration.test.ts` | 41 | Full inject→verify round-trip |
| `trigger-coverage.test.ts` | 147 | 72 prompt-to-keyword validations |
| `mapping-completeness.test.ts` | 12 | Orphan detection, content quality |
| **Total** | **551** | |

### Priority Order

1. **Hook injection tests** (Category 1) ✅ — Highest confidence, fully deterministic
2. **Disambiguation tests** (Known Challenges table) ✅ — Highest risk, verified
3. **Trigger coverage** (All categories) ✅ — Keyword validation for all 72 prompts
4. **Pipeline integration** ✅ — End-to-end hook behavior
5. **Mapping completeness** ✅ — No orphan skills, all references valid
6. **VS Code skill resolution** ⚠️ — Blocked on extension API access
7. **LLM agent routing** ⚠️ — Blocked on runtime test harness
