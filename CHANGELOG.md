## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Shipped agent templates referenced 19 skills that do not ship.** `inject-skills.mjs`
  mapped `researcher` to `.github/skills/web-search/SKILL.md` and `ux-designer` to
  `.github/prompts/ui-ux-pro-max/PROMPT.md`; neither exists in the package, so skill
  injection failed to a warning on every install. Those references, and the Azure/Entra
  skill references in five agent definitions, are removed.
- **Template `verify-skills.mjs` was an older revision** than the repo's own hook —
  it challenged on skill compliance but not task tracking. Synced.
- **Skill tests ran against this repo's dev install** (`.github/`, ~31 skills) instead of
  the shipped `templates/` (6 skills), which is why the broken references passed CI.
  Retargeted, and injection assertions now fail on a "could not load" warning rather
  than passing on its length.

### Changed
- **README corrected to match what ships.** Removed the "Orchestration Engine" and
  "LLM Provider" layers, the "full agentic loop"/Azure OpenAI claims, and the `openai`,
  `@azure/identity`, and Zod tech-stack rows — none of that code or dependency exists.
  Dropped unshipped skills (UI UX Pro Max, Azure Operations, Web Search) and MCP servers
  (Azure, Brave), documented the required `backlog` server and the `pre-push-guard`
  command, pinned the MCP snippet to real versions, and fixed a stale "Node ≥18".

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-31

### Breaking Changes
- **ADO Sync removed** — the `ado-sync` integration and its Azure auth dependencies (`@azure/msal-node`, `@azure/msal-node-extensions`) are gone. Use the Backlog.md CLI directly.
- **Public API surface removed** — Beth ships as a CLI only. The programmatic `main`/`exports` entry points are no longer published; import paths into the package will no longer resolve.

### Removed
- 35 unreferenced vendored skill bundles.
- Unshipped `swarm/` prototype and its stale compiled artifacts.
- Dead code with zero callers, duplicated color/logging helpers, and an unused DI interface.
- Unused dependency `aiohttp`.

### Changed
- Hand-rolled utilities replaced with stdlib equivalents.
- Template validation no longer depends on the removed loader module.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **`npx beth-copilot uninstall` command** — Cleanly removes all Beth-installed files from a project: `.github/agents/`, `.github/skills/`, `.github/hooks/`, `AGENTS.md`, `Backlog.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.vscode/settings.json`, `mcp.json.example`, and `backlog/` directory. Removes Beth guard block from pre-push hook (preserving non-Beth content). Cleans up empty `.github/` and `.vscode/` directories. 17 tests covering all removal paths.
- **Auto-derived backlog prefix** — `backlog init` during `beth-copilot init` now automatically derives a 6-letter prefix from the project name (e.g., `my-app` → `MYAPP`), eliminating the interactive prompt that blocked agent workflows.

### Fixed
- **Shell command injection in backlog init** — Fixed GHAS-flagged command injection vulnerability where unsanitized project directory names were interpolated into shell commands. Now validates input against a strict allowlist pattern before use.

### Changed
- **885 tests** — Up from 860 in v2.0.0. Added uninstall command tests and init prefix derivation coverage.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-16

### Breaking Changes
- **Beads removed — Backlog.md is the sole task tracker.** The entire beads/Dolt database layer has been removed. All agent instructions, hooks, and CLI commands now use `backlog` CLI exclusively. If you were using `bd` commands in scripts, they will no longer be referenced by Beth agents.
- **`npx beth-copilot close` command removed** (~560 lines deleted). This command enforced beads-specific close logic (blocker deps, child issues, mandatory test subtasks via `bd`). The workflow is now handled by `backlog task edit BETH-X -s "Done" --plain`.

### Added
- **Backlog.md CLI integration** — All agent instructions now reference `backlog task create`, `backlog task edit`, `backlog task list`, `backlog board`, and `backlog overview` commands. The `--plain` flag is enforced everywhere to prevent TUI mode in agent contexts.
- **`npx beth-copilot update` command** — Updates project files to latest templates without full re-init. Supports `--check-only` for dry-run inspection.
- **Behavioral skill tests** — 302 E2E skill routing tests across 3 files validating deterministic hook injection, trigger coverage, and mapping completeness.
- **SubagentStart/SubagentStop hook enforcement** — `inject-skills.mjs` deterministically maps agent types to required skills. `verify-skills.mjs` gates subagent completion on both skill compliance and task tracking.
- **Hub-and-spoke agent coordination** — Replaced 15 lateral handoffs across 6 agents with single "Escalate to Beth" handoff per agent. All agents now report to Beth.
- **Community skills** — Added brainstorming, framer-components, frontend-design, proof, rclone, feature-video, and other community-contributed skill modules.
- **27+ Azure skills** — Full Azure skill suite: compute, storage, AI, messaging, diagnostics, compliance, RBAC, cost optimization, cloud migration, resource lookup/visualizer, Entra ID, Copilot SDK, Foundry, and more.
- **860 tests** — Up from 438 in v1.1.0. Comprehensive coverage for CLI commands, skill routing, hook injection, pipeline integration, and path validation.

### Changed
- **Agent instructions rewritten for Backlog.md** — All 7 agent files (`beth.agent.md`, `developer.agent.md`, etc.) and `AGENTS.md` updated to reference `backlog` CLI instead of `bd` commands.
- **Hook enforcement updated** — `verify-skills.mjs` now checks for `backlog task edit` compliance instead of `bd` commands.
- **Templates synced** — All template files in `templates/` now match live `.github/` configuration.
- **Test framework consolidated** — Migrated from mixed `node:test`/vitest to vitest-only imports across all test files.

### Removed
- **`beth-copilot close` command** — Entire close command and its 560-line implementation deleted.
- **Beads stub functions** — Removed `bd`-related stubs from `bin/cli.js`.
- **Dead code cleanup** — Removed 8 redundant/deprecated skills, unused `bs-buster` dependency, dead `bin/lib` files, legacy test scripts, empty barrel exports, and orphaned documentation.
- **Dolt/beads references** — Purged from all production source code, agent instructions, templates, and documentation.

### Fixed
- **Template drift** — Templates now stay in sync with live `.github/` config via the `update` command.
- **Duplicate tools in beth.agent.md** — Removed duplicate tool entries in frontmatter.
- **Dead pathValidation.ts exports** — Cleaned unused exports that inflated the public API surface.
- **Pre-push guard test isolation** — Removed unused `child_process` mock that caused CI failures.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **`npx beth-copilot land` command** — Automates session completion: verifies epic branch, runs tests, backs up beads, stages/commits/pushes, verifies sync. Options: `--skip-tests`, `--skip-backup`, `--message/-m`, `--force`, `--dry-run`. Protected branch blocking, epic ID extraction for commit prefixes, non-blocking beads backup, structured step results.
- **`npx beth-copilot close` enforcement** — 3-layer close enforcement: (1) open blocker dependencies via `bd dep list`, (2) open children via `bd children`, (3) mandatory test subtasks (unit/e2e/security) for epics. `--force` bypasses all checks.
- **Pre-push hook** — Git pre-push hook enforcing branch discipline: blocks pushes from `main`/`master` (exit 1), warns on non-epic branch names. Pure shell hook (no Node overhead). Auto-installed during `npx beth-copilot init`. Bypass with `BETH_SKIP_PUSH_GUARD=1`.
- **Quality gate infrastructure** — `npm run test:gate` generates markdown test reports to `docs/test-reports/`. `scripts/quality-gate.mjs` runs vitest + legacy tests, parses results, generates report, exits non-zero on failure.
- **Comprehensive CLI test suite** — 7 new test files: `close.e2e.test.ts`, `pre-push-guard.e2e.test.ts`, `quickstart-expanded.e2e.test.ts`, `cli-edge-cases.e2e.test.ts`, `framework-isolation.test.ts`, `init-logic.e2e.test.ts`, `doctor.e2e.test.ts`. 438 tests total.
- **Doctor: Dolt database hygiene** — `checkDoltDatabases()` detects orphaned `*test*` databases and warns when user DB count exceeds threshold. Extracted `parseDoltDatabases()` with 18 unit tests.
- **Session startup drift-prevention** — Mandatory 4-step session startup checklist in AGENTS.md: check uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, spot-check closed work, sync beads state.
- **Beads disaster recovery docs** — `docs/BD-BACKUP-PARSER-FAILURE.md` with exact parser error, root cause, repro steps, and 3 recovery paths.
- **Mandatory test subtask rules** — Epic creation patterns now require unit/E2E/security test subtasks across all agent files.

### Changed
- **Hub-and-spoke agent coordination** — Replaced 15 lateral handoffs across 6 agents with single "Escalate to Beth" handoff per agent. Before: 15-edge mesh where agents bypassed orchestration. After: all agents report to Beth.
- **Skill routing optimization** — Added Skill Routing Table to Beth agent. Subagent templates restructured with explicit skill loading instructions. All 8 skills wired to agents (zero orphaned).
- **Shared boilerplate extraction** — Replaced ~120 lines of duplicated Work Tracking + Team Coordination across 12 files with compact AGENTS.md reference. Net -260 lines.
- **Areas of Expertise** migrated to compact on-demand pointers — net -135 lines across 6 agents.
- **Landing command hardening** — `isUpToDateWithOrigin` rewritten to compare SHA refs directly, `remoteBranchExists()` helper, `gitRebaseAbort()` for conflict recovery.
- **Simplified architecture diagrams** — All mermaid diagrams in README.md and SYSTEM-FLOW.md rewritten for accuracy. Removed fake component references that don't exist in src/.
- **Standardized on npm** — Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml`, regenerated `package-lock.json`, added `packageManager` field.

### Fixed
- **Pre-push-guard E2E branch assumptions** — Reworked E2E harness to create temporary git repos on explicit branches instead of assuming CI branch state.
- **Framework isolation** — Fixed `beforeAll`/`afterAll` imports from `node:test` (doesn't export those names; vitest alias masked the problem).
- **hasStagedChanges false positives** — Now distinguishes exit-1 (diffs) from unexpected errors.
- **Rebase conflict handling** — Land command now aborts cleanly on rebase conflicts instead of proceeding to push.
- **Beads E2E test pollution** — `beforeAll` safety net batch-deletes stale test issues from previous failed runs.
- **Beads database recovery** — Documented recovery from Dolt server database loss after orphaned test DBs overloaded server.
