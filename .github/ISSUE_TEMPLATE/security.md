⚠️ **STOP** ⚠️

**For serious security vulnerabilities, DO NOT create a public issue.**

Please use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature or email the maintainers directly.

See [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) for details.
