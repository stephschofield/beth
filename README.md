She doesn't do excuses. She doesn't do hand-holding. She does results—and she'll have your entire project shipping while everyone else is still scheduling their kickoff meeting. Think of her as the managing director your codebase didn't know it needed, but absolutely deserves.

They broke her wings once. They forgot she had claws.

---

## What Is This?

Beth is a master AI orchestrator system—a ruthless, hyper-competent coordinator that runs your development team the way Beth Dutton runs Schwartz & Meyer. No hand-holding. No excuses. Just results.

She commands an army of specialized agents, each with their own expertise, and she's not afraid to put them to work simultaneously while she lights a cigarette and watches the crew build production-ready code.

**She handles:**
- Product strategy that makes competitors weep
- Research that finds the real dirt
- Designs so sharp they cut
- Code that actually works
- Security that locks the gates
- Tests that find every weakness before your enemies do

## The Family

Beth doesn't work alone. She's got people—loyal, skilled, and ready to execute.

| Agent | Role | What They Do |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **@Beth** | The Boss | Orchestrates everything. Routes work. Takes names. |
| **@product-manager** | The Strategist | PRDs, roadmaps, requirements. Knows what users need before they do. |
| **@researcher** | The Intelligence | Competitive analysis, user insights, market dirt. |
| **@ux-designer** | The Architect | Interface design, design systems. Makes it beautiful AND functional. |
| **@frontend-engineer** | The Craftsman | React/TypeScript/Next.js. Pixel-perfect, performance-obsessed. |
| **@developer** | The Builder | Full-stack implementation. Gets it done. |
| **@tester** | The Enforcer | Quality assurance, accessibility, performance. Finds every crack. |
| **@security-reviewer** | The Bodyguard | Enterprise security. Vulnerabilities, compliance, threat modeling. |

## Skills (The Weapons)

Beth's team comes equipped:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **PRD Generation** | Write requirements docs that don't waste anyone's time |
| **Framer Components** | Build custom React components with property controls |
| **React/Next.js Best Practices** | Vercel-grade performance patterns |
| **Web Design Guidelines** | WCAG compliance, UI review, accessibility |
| **Security Analysis** | OWASP, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment |

## How Beth Works

She doesn't micromanage. She delegates to specialists and holds them accountable.

### The Workflow

**New Feature?**
```
Request → Product (requirements) → Research (validation) → Design (interface) 
       → Frontend (components) → Developer (backend) → Security (review) → Tester (QA)
```

**Bug Hunt?**
```
Report → Tester (reproduce) → Developer (fix) → Security (verify) → Tester (confirm)
```

**Security Audit?**
```
Concern → Security (threat model) → Developer (remediation) → Tester (penetration)
```

## Getting Started

**New here?** Follow the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for complete setup instructions.

**Quick start:**
1. Clone this repo and open in VS Code
2. Ensure GitHub Copilot + Copilot Chat extensions are installed
3. Switch to **Agent mode** in Copilot Chat
4. Type `@Beth` and tell her what you need
5. Stay out of her way

For detailed setup including prerequisites, task tracking, and optional MCP servers, see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## Quick Commands

Don't waste her time. Be direct.

```
@Beth Build me a dashboard for user analytics with real-time updates.
```

```
@Beth Security review for our authentication flow. Find the holes.
```

```
@frontend-engineer Implement a drag-and-drop task board. Make it fast.
```

```
@security-reviewer OWASP top 10 assessment on our API endpoints.
```

```
@tester Accessibility audit. WCAG 2.1 AA. No excuses.
```

## Her Philosophy

Beth operates on a few principles:

1. **Protect the family** — Your codebase is the ranch. She defends it.
2. **No weakness** — Tests, security, accessibility. Cover every flank.
3. **Move fast, break enemies** — Parallel execution, aggressive timelines.
4. **Loyalty earns trust** — Agents that perform get the good work.

## Quality Standards

Beth doesn't ship garbage:

- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA minimum. Everyone uses the product.
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals green. LCP < 2.5s. No exceptions.
- **Security**: OWASP compliant. Regular audits. Zero tolerance for vulnerabilities.
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage. No `any` unless you want a lecture.
- **Test Coverage**: Unit, integration, E2E. If it's not tested, it's not done.

## Why Beth?

</p>

Look, you *could* try to coordinate seven specialists yourself. You could context-switch between product strategy, security reviews, and accessibility audits while keeping your sanity intact. 

Or you could let Beth handle it.

She's got the crew. She's got the workflows. She delegates like a managing director because that's exactly what she is. You bring the problem, she brings the people—and somehow, the code ships on time, secure, and accessible.

Is it magic? No. It's just competence with very good hair.

## Requirements

- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- GitHub Copilot Chat enabled
- The spine to actually ship something

### Optional: MCP Servers

Beth's agents work fine without them, but these make them smarter:

| Server | What It Does | Setup |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **shadcn/ui** | Component browsing & installation | `npx shadcn@latest mcp init --client vscode` |
| **Playwright** | Browser automation for testing | See [MCP Setup Guide](docs/MCP-SETUP.md) |
| **Azure** | Cloud resource management | See [MCP Setup Guide](docs/MCP-SETUP.md) |
| **Web Search** | Internet research | See [MCP Setup Guide](docs/MCP-SETUP.md) |
